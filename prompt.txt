I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML","number":"6","start":732.0,"end":733.0,"text":" You can learn here."},{"title":"SEO and Core Web Vitals in HTML","number":"6","start":751.0,"end":752.0,"text":" CSS."},{"title":"CSS Box Model - Margin Padding Borders","number":"18","start":5.0,"end":6.64,"text":" A like is required for this free course."},{"title":"Installing VS Code How Websites Work","number":"1","start":5.0,"end":6.64,"text":" A like is required for this free course."},{"title":"Inline Block Elements in HTML","number":"8","start":5.0,"end":6.64,"text":" A like is required for this free course."}]
---------------------------------
"where is the css taught in this course"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
